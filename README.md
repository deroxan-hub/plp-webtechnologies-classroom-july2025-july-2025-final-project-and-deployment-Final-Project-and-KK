A corporate communications graduate currently undertaking the Web Development Module from Power Learn Project.
This is my first submission for my  first-ever Hackathon and my first Software Project in General.
'https://kariukikimotho.netlify.app/' is the domain address

Upon clicking, the user is directed to a simple page that contains information regarding my aptitude in the languages I have learned during my time enrolled at Power Learn Project.
Clicking the 'About Me' button will direct the user towards more personalized information about me, including my level of education and the various levels I have achieved.
It also contains my Curriculum Vitae, which is available for viewing and downloading if the user wishes.

A section on the main page is designated to offer links whereby a user is able to contact me through various platforms, such as Email and LinkedIn, for further communication.

I have enjoyed creating my first website as well as undertaking my first project. I look forward to creating more and contributing my skills to better myself and aid the community at large
Thank you.
